GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to store and manage their code, track changes, and collaborate on projects.

In the future, I can use GitHub to collaborate on open-source projects, share my code with others, and contribute to software development communities. GitHub will also help me manage version control in personal projects and work in teams.

GitHub Inc. was founded in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, and Scott Chacon. The GitHub service became publicly available in April 2008.
